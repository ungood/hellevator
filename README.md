*LuciFurr is oh so lonely down in Hell. Have you earned your right to pass into paradise? Find out as the HELLEVATOR takes you 12,256 miles below Playa. Black Rock City's only underground attraction. It's easy to find....simply look for the the elevator shed with the big wheel on top of the HELLEVATOR sign. Sinners, Burners and Angels are welcome.*
